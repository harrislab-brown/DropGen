# Welcome to DropGen
## A droplet on demand generator for research applications developed in the Harris Lab at Brown University

DropGen uses a fluid reservoir and a piezoelectric buzzer to precisely and repeatably dispense small droplets on demand. 
This new version of the Harris Lab DropGen is designed to be 3D printed using filament based FDM printers. Harris Lab has developed a custom printed circuit board to make assembly and use of DropGen as easy as possible, including adding the ability to control the height of DropGen with a commonly available stepper motor driven linear actuator. 

Complete build documentation and user guide for DropGen can be found under the Wiki tab of this repository.
